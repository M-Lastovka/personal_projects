The RISE IP is a speculative instruction prefetcher designed for the RISC-V open-source RI5CY CPU. The purpose of this IP is to remove the 
critical combinational path inferred by a long read-delay instructions memory. The thesis describes the IP's architecture, implementation, 
synthesis, verification and parameter optimization
