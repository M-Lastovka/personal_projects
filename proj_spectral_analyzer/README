This projects implements a spectral analyzer that is intended for audio signals analysis (BW 0 - 20 kHz). The project implements sampling and storing
of ADC data, windowing, FFT computation and uploading of the data to the PC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The used board is the TUL PYNQ Z2 board. The used ADC is the board's XADC. The data are collected and saved in the DDRAM by the Zynq PS. The AXI
Stream is used for sending the data to and from the PL which implements the FFT and windowing (Welch method is used). The number of samples and the
bit resolution is reconfigurable. The FFT is a classic Cooley-Tukey Radix2 implementation with decimation in frequency. The twiddle factors are 
stored in a ROM and so are window samples (Hann window), the VHDL file for the ROMs are generated by a matlab script. The incoming data are zero 
padded for increased resolution in frequency The overlapping FFT data segments are stored in the DDRAM and then sent to the PC via USB by the Zynq PS.

File contents:

src/PL - source files for the FFT, AXI stream slave and master, PS wrapper

src/PS - source files for the Zynq PS

sw - scripts for displaying of the computed data, scripts for generating the ROM tables

sim - simulation testbench

doc - documentation

Project status: Not complete, so far FFT processing has been designed and simulated, AXI stream slave/master has been designed and simulated
                This project is obsolete, FFT IP will be reworked in RTL_FFT_on_Zynq repo

TODO: create and package the as an IP
      verify the IP with the Xilinx AXI Stream verification IP
      do system the block design(use AXI DMA, interrupt controller etc.)
      write the SW for the PL side(starting FFT operations, sending the outputted data through ethernet)
      sanity testing of the whole system
