This projects implements a spectral analyzer that is intended for audio signals analysis (BW 0 - 20 kHz). The project implements sampling and storing
of ADC data, windowing, FFT computation and uploading of the data to the PC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The used board is the TUL PYNQ Z2 board. The used ADC is the board's XADC. The data are collected and saved in the DDRAM by the Zynq PS. The AXI
Stream is used for sending the data to and from the PL which implements the FFT and windowing (Welch method is used). The number of samples and the
bit resolution is reconfigurable. The FFT is a classic Cooley-Tukey Radix2 implementation with decimation in frequency. The twiddle factors are 
stored in a ROM, the VHDL file for the ROM is generated by a matlab script. The chosen window function is the Hann window, its samples are also stored 
in a ROM. The overlapping FFT data segments are stored in the DDRAM and then sent to the PC via USB by the Zynq PS.

File contents:

src - source files for the FFT, AXI stream slave and master, PS wrapper

sw - scripts for displaying of the computed data, scripts for generating the ROM tables

sim - simulation testbench

doc - documentation
