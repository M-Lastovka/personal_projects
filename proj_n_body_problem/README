This project is a numerical simulation of the N-body problem (gravitational) and it is done exclusively in Matlab. 
The goal was to provide some nice visualisation when thinking about problems of motion of bodies in potential fields.
I also experimented with doing animations and interactive menus in Matlab. You can either choose to simulate on of
the presets or you can manually enter the initial conditions for your own N-body problem.

In the src folder you'll find all the Matlab codes required to run this project.
